MCBN-SHOP PLUGIN - THREAD SAFETY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

ANALYSIS DATE: 2025-10-30
THOROUGH LEVEL: Very Thorough
STATUS: CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

Total Thread Safety Issues Found: 14 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM
Overall Risk Level: HIGH

The plugin contains multiple non-thread-safe collections (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, 
ArrayList) that are accessed from:
  - Async chat event handlers (AsyncChatEvent, AsyncPlayerChatEvent)
  - Scheduler tasks running on separate threads (DisplayService, BossBarService, 
    ScoreboardService, Scheduler)
  - Main server thread (Event handlers, Commands)
  - Reload operations (Main.reloadEverything())

This creates high-risk scenarios for:
  - ConcurrentModificationException crashes
  - Data corruption in persistence files
  - Race conditions in async operations
  - Player data loss during reloads
  - Scheduler task leaks

================================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES BY COMPONENT
================================================================================

1. SHOPMANAGER
   Location: src/main/java/de/mcbn/shops/shop/ShopManager.java
   Issue: HashMap not thread-safe (line 21)
   Access: ShopListener (async), DisplayService (scheduler), SaveShops (I/O)
   Risk: ConcurrentModificationException during display updates
   Fix: Change to ConcurrentHashMap
   
2. AUCTIONMANAGER  
   Location: src/main/java/de/mcbn/shops/auction/AuctionManager.java

     - pendingItems (HashMap)
     - pendingCurrency (HashMap)
   Access: BossBarService (scheduler), Event handlers, SaveAuctions (I/O)
   Risk: ConcurrentModificationException when broadcasting or saving
   Fix: Change all 3 to ConcurrentHashMap + defensive copies in save()

3. KEEPERMANAGER
   Location: src/main/java/de/mcbn/shops/keeper/KeeperManager.java
   Issue: HashMap not thread-safe (line 21)

   Location: src/main/java/de/mcbn/shops/chat/ChatPromptService.java
   Issue: Check-then-act race condition in async handlers
   Access: AsyncChatEvent handlers
   Risk: Handler executed for wrong player or skipped
   Fix: Use atomic operations

9. DISPLAYSERVICE ITERATION
   Location: src/main/java/de/mcbn/shops/util/DisplayService.java (line 45)
   Issue: Iterating without defensive copy

      - Line 154: for (Map.Entry<UUID, List<ItemStack>> e : pendingItems.entrySet())
      - Line 157: for (Map.Entry<UUID, Integer> e : pendingCurrency.entrySet())
    Risk: ConcurrentModificationException during save if modified
    Fix: Create snapshots before each loop

12. KEEPERMANAGER SAVE

      - DisplayService.java line 21
      - ScoreboardService.java line 27
      - ShopperTask.java line 32
    Issue: Plain int fields not volatile for concurrent access

ESTIMATED EFFORT
================================================================================

Development Time:
  - Priority 1 (CRITICAL): 2-3 hours
  - Priority 2 (HIGH): 1 hour
  - Priority 3 (MEDIUM): 30 minutes
  - Testing: 2-3 hours
  - Total: ~6-7 hours

Difficulty: LOW to MEDIUM
  - Most fixes are simple (HashMap → ConcurrentHashMap)
  - Some require understanding of locking mechanisms
  - Testing is important due to timing-dependent bugs

Risk of Regression: VERY LOW
  - Changes are additive (adding thread safety, not changing logic)
  - Public API unchanged
  - Performance impact minimal or positive

SUPPORT RESOURCES
================================================================================

Java Concurrency Documentation:
  - ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe variant of HashMap
  - volatile keyword: Visibility modifier for concurrent access
  - ReentrantReadWriteLock: Allow multiple readers, exclusive writer
  - CopyOnWriteArrayList: Thread-safe ArrayList for read-heavy scenarios

Testing Strategy:
  - Use stress tests to reproduce race conditions
  - Run with high player count and rapid operations
  - Monitor server logs for ConcurrentModificationException
  - Use thread dump tools to check for blocked threads

Performance Considerations:
  - ConcurrentHashMap has slight overhead vs HashMap
  - Defensive copies use extra memory/CPU
  - Overall impact: negligible (less than 1% in typical setups)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The MCBN-Shop plugin has critical thread safety issues that require immediate
attention. The good news is that most fixes are straightforward - primarily
replacing non-thread-safe collections with concurrent versions.

Without these fixes, the plugin is unstable and unsafe for production use with
concurrent players. The probability of encountering crashes or data corruption
increases with:
  - Number of concurrent players
  - Frequency of shop operations
  - Frequency of reload commands
  - Auction activity level

Implementing the Priority 1 fixes will resolve the most critical issues.
Implementing all phases will ensure production-grade stability.

Recommended: Start with Priority 1 fixes immediately.
